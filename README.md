## Introduction

Vision-language supervised fine-tuning effectively enhances VLLM performance, but existing visual instruction tuning datasets have limitations:

1. **Instruction Annotation Quality**: Despite strong performance, advanced VLLMs may generate instructions with inaccuracies, such as hallucinations.
2. **Instruction and Image Diversity**: Limited instruction types and lack of diverse image data impact the model's ability to generate varied and realistic outputs.


### MMInstruct Dataset

To address these challenges, we created the MMInstruct dataset, featuring:
- **973K instructions** from **24 domains**
- Four instruction types: Judgement, Multiple-Choice, Long Visual Question Answering, and Short Visual Question Answering.

The open source datasets on Hugging Face [ðŸ¤— yuecao0119/MMInstruct](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yuecao0119/MMInstruct-GPT4V) include:

* `caption_cn`: 144K English detailed image caption data generated using *gpt-4-vision-preview*.
* `caption_en`: 18.2K Chinese detailed image caption data generated using *gpt-4-vision-preview*.
* `qa_en`: 216K instruction data generated using *GPT-3.5-turbo*, including 161K multi-round long questions and answers and 55K manually corrected instruction data from 23 fields, as shown in the figure below.

We also expand MMInstruct with other open-source data, including:

### Data Engine

We developed an instruction generation data engine leveraging GPT-4V, GPT-3.5, and manual correction. This engine allows semi-automatic, low-cost, multi-domain instruction generation at 1/6 the cost of manual construction.
